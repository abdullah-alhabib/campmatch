Hi Team,

We’re excited to invite your amazing company to join us as a vendor for the ARAMCO-UAE Group projects and services coming up in 2025. This is a fantastic opportunity to work together and make a meaningful impact.

These projects are open to everyone, worldwide! If you’re interested, just let us know, and we’ll send over the Vendor Questionnaire and Expression of Interest (EOI) form to get started.

We’d love to have you on board and can’t wait to hear from you!

Warm regards,
Mr. Jamil Mualwid
